SailfishOS-Calendar-WeekPage
============================

patch and files to enable a Weekpage in the Jolla SailfishOS Calendar

You can use the rpm to install the patch using the patchmanager
or install it manually by using "patch -p1" or by copying the sources manually.

This is my first qml project, so its far away from 
perfekt but in my opinion very helpful.
Any criticism and help that helps improving the WeekPage 
and/or the calendar is highly appreciated.

Cheers,
Alex
